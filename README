Play with Prolog
----------------

This project contains all my experimental codes written in Prolog. Prolog is a beautiful logic programming language. To think of anything in a recursive manner, prolog is one good place to start.

DCG.P - Contains Context free grammars and Propositional Logic routines

resolution.P - Contains Conjuntive normal forms and resolution logic

first_order.P - first order formula and parsing.

benchmark.P - Contains code that benchmarks the performance of left, right and double recursive predicates

language_parser.P - A tiny compiler for a sample programming language with given syntax

language_eval.P - A tiny interpreter for a sample programming language with restricted functionalities

stratify.P - Code does stratification on the given list of predicates
